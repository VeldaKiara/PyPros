positional arguments are assignments that 
depend on their
positions in the function call
We can also pass these arguments as 
keyword arguments, where we explicitly 
refer to what each argument 
is assigned to in the function call.
We can use keyword arguments to 
make it explicit what each of our arguments
 to a function should refer 
to in the body of the function itself.
We can also define default arguments 
for a function using syntax very similar
 to our keyword-argument syntax,
  but used during the function definition. 
  If the function is called without
   an argument for that parameter, 
it relies on the default.
