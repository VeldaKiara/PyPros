#A dictionary is an unordered set of key: value pairs.
#A dictionary begins and ends with curly braces ({ and }).
''' Each item consists of a key (i.e., “oatmeal”) and a value (i.e., 3)
    Each key: value pair (i.e., "oatmeal": 3 or "avocado toast": 6) is separated by a comma (,)
    It’s considered good practice to insert a space () after each comma,
     but your code will still run without the space.'''
